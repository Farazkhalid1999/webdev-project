            <h1>Models Of Good Practise</h1>
            <br>
            <p>My team and I looked at a variety of different websites when thinking how we will design our own website. Our team decided that what makes a website stand out are colours and images. We thought that colours are important as they represent different types of emotions. This mean that we would have to research and find websites that used colours in an effective way.
                    One website that we took inspiration off was Airbnb. The reason why we chose Airbnb was because they use a very simplistic white and red colour scheme. The colours themselves are not glossy but almost have a matte look to them. They also use large text with a consistent colour, this gives the website a nice look and feel. Airbnb also use many images. Images give the website a visual aspect, userâ€™s can see what the website wants to show them. Therefore our team decided that any website inspiration we get will be from websites that use images and colours effectively.
                    <p>
                    Another website that we took inspiration of was dropbox. The reason why we chose dropbox is because the layout of dropbox is very nice. It gave us an idea of how we will layout our websites. Dropbox has images at the top and text in the middle.
