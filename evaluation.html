            <h1>Evaluation</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Within the first term of this module I have learnt quite a lot about web development. The first thing that I have learnt about web development is that there are many types of programming languages you can use in order to create a website, you can even use two or more programming languages together to create an efficient and responsive website such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. During this assignment, I learnt that making a website takes a lot of patience and practice. The reason why I say that is because when writing code you need to make sure that things such as signs, caps lock and other features are right otherwise the computer will not recognise the piece of code and will give you an error, this happened a lot to me as I spent most of my time just trying to fix small errors.
                    
                <p>Another factor that was hard about this assignment was the planning before I even started to write my website up in HTML and CSS was how I was going to layout my website and the design. This took a long time as I had no idea how to start and so I looked up and took inspiration from many different companies websites. Two websites I based mine off of was Airbnb and Dropbox, I really liked the simplicity of their websites and transferred that strategy to my website.
                    <p>There are some things I could have changed however, one thing I could have focused more on is the cross platforming and how the website will look if I open it up in different browsers such as google chrome, internet explorer, firefox etc. I also think I could have changed the background of the website too, if I had researched a bit more I could have learnt how to make the background look as if it moves when a user scrolls up or down just like the apple website does.
                    <p>Overall, I think my website has achieved my goal of it being simplistic and easy to use for the user. There are some things that I would have changed such as how the background works or some of the colour schemes however the website still looks good even without it.

                A wireframe I designed before starting the assignment, figuring out how I will structure my website
            </p>
            <img src="images/validation1.jpg" alt="web" width="480px"><p>
              As you can see this is what the website would look like if it was on a 1920 x 1080 display, i used the inspect element tool on chrome to check this.  
            </p>    
            <img src="images/validation2.jpg" alt="web" width="480px"><p>
             Using the Inspect Element tool i then checked what the website will look like if it was on a mobile phone, as you can see the layout is still good as users can scroll up or down and nothing is distorted or ruined.
