            <h1>Games Developer</h1>
            <br>
            <p>As a Games Developer, you are responsible for creating games for either the public or certain clients. Like a
                Web Developer a degree in IT is needed or something similar such as software engineering. Game Developers
                like Web Developers need to have knowledge in coding however Game Developers need to be very good at designing
                and need to be creative as the nature of their job requires the person to think outside of the box to come
                up with new ideas for their game. Game Developers do not just focus on coding and designing they also do
                many other tasks such as creating story lines for their games, creating prototypes or beta versions of their
                game for people to test on, creating role-play mechanics etc.

                in they may have to create different types of software ranging from security software to everyday software
                used by the public. Usually like the other jobs having a degree in an IT related field helps to gain a high
                salary job. Main skills to become a Software Developer is to have good math skills and having a logical mind,
