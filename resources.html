<h1>W3 Schools</h1>
<br>
<p>W3Schools is a website that provides a variety of solutions to problems relating with coding. Specifically W3Schools provides solutions to HTML and CSS, it was originally launched in 1998 to provide tutorials to beginners who wanted to learn HTML and CSS and still provides tutorials to beginners and advanced developers through interactive exercises and videos. Later on W3Schools started to release tutorials about Javascript, PHP, SQL etc. as more programming languages were being popularised. The main reason why W3Schools is popular amongst many programmers is because it shows the code itself needed to create the functions.Programmers can use that code to help them solve their own problems.

The webiste was made in 2008, the overall idea was that when a user has posted a question and responses came through users could then vote the answers and show whether they are helpful or not.This then allows other users to quickly find out the solutions to the problems and the best method to do so. Stackflow also allows users to gain points or badges which then shows that they are trustworthy and knowledgable in their specific industry or field. This means that if any users have any questions in terms of a specific topic then they can ask those who have badges or points as they know what they are talking about.
